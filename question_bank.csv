Which planet is known as the Red Planet?,Earth,Venus,Jupiter,Mars,Mars,"Mars is known as the Red Planet because of its distinctive reddish appearance, which comes from iron oxide—commonly known as rust—on its surface. This gives the planet its dusty red hue, easily visible even from Earth with a telescope"
What is the name of the largest moon in our solar system?,Enceladus,Ganymede,Iro,Moon,Ganymede,"Ganymede, a moon of Jupiter, is the largest moon in the solar system. It’s even bigger than the planet Mercury, with a diameter of about 5,268 kilometers (3,273 miles). Ganymede has a magnetic field, icy surface, and a subsurface ocean that scientists believe might contain more water than all of Earth’s oceans combined."
What type of celestial body is the Sun?,Star,Planet,Black Hole,Galaxy,Star,"The Sun is a star, specifically a G-type main-sequence star (also called a yellow dwarf). Like other stars, it produces energy through nuclear fusion in its core, converting hydrogen into helium. This process releases the light and heat that supports life on Earth."
Which galaxy contains our solar system?,Ursa Major,Snickers,Andromeda,Milky Way,Milky Way,"The Milky Way is the spiral galaxy that contains our solar system. It’s a vast system of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter stretching about 100,000 light-years across. Our Sun is located in one of its outer arms, called the Orion Arm."
What is the name of the first artificial satellite?,Sputnik 2,Sputnik 1,Hubble,ISS,Sputnik 1,"Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite launched into space. It was launched by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, marking the beginning of the space age and the start of the U.S.–Soviet space race. The satellite transmitted radio pulses and orbited Earth for three weeks before its batteries died."
What is the name of the largest planet in our solar system?,Saturn,Jupiter,Pluto,Venus,Jupiter,"Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system by far. It's a gas giant with a diameter of about 143,000 kilometers (89,000 miles) and more than 300 times the mass of Earth.

What is the name of the smallest planet in our solar system?,Venus,Earth,Pluto,Mercury,Mercury,"Mercury is the smallest of the eight recognized planets in our solar system. It's only about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles) in diameter—slightly larger than Earth’s Moon. Despite its small size, Mercury is incredibly dense and orbits the Sun faster than any other planet, completing a full orbit in just 88 Earth days."
How many planets are in our solar system?,7,8,10,9,8,"There are eight planets in our solar system, listed in order from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto was once considered the ninth planet but was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 due to its size and orbital characteristics."
"What is the name of the celestial object that has a bright,  glowing tail?",Comet,Asteroid,Meteor,Meteorite,Comet,"A comet is a small Solar System body made mostly of ice, dust, and rocky particles. When a comet approaches the Sun, the heat causes its ices to vaporize, releasing gas and dust. This forms a glowing coma around the nucleus and a visible tail that always points away from the Sun due to the solar wind and radiation pressure. The tail can stretch millions of kilometers across space and is what makes comets so visually striking in the night sky."
What is the name of the phenomenon where the Earth orbits the Sun?,Revolution,Evolution,Rotate,Gravity,Revolution,"Revolution refers to the orbital movement of the Earth around the Sun. It takes approximately 365.25 days to complete one full revolution, which defines the length of a year. This motion, combined with Earth's axial tilt, is responsible for the changing seasons throughout the year."
What is the name of the phenomenon where the Earth rotates on its axis?,Atmosphere,Gravity,Axel,Rotation,Rotation,"Rotation is the spinning of the Earth around its own axis. This motion takes approximately 24 hours to complete and causes the cycle of day and night. Unlike revolution, which is the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, rotation is what makes the Sun appear to rise and set each day."
What is the name of the force that pulls objects towards each other?,Mass,Force,Energy,Gravity,Gravity,"Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes every object with mass to attract every other object with mass. This force keeps planets in orbit around the Sun, causes objects to fall to the ground on Earth, and governs the large-scale structure of the universe."
What is used as a measure of distance in space?,Light-years,Newton,Joule,Watt,Light-year,"A light-year is the distance that light travels in one year through a vacuum — about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). It is commonly used by astronomers to express distances between stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects because of the vast scales involved."
What is the name of the space probe that has traveled farthest from the Sun?,Voyager 2,Voyager 1,New Horizons,Cassini,Voyager 1,"Voyager 1 is the farthest human-made object from the Sun, launched in 1977.

And in addition to those 18, the planets can appear in six more: Canis Minor, Crater, Hydra, Pegasus, Scutum, and Serpens, with a total of 24."
How much of sunlight is light?,33%,63%,43%,93%,43%,"What we call “sunlight” is actually a mixture of visible light, infrared radiation (heat), and ultraviolet radiation. When light leaves the Sun, the mixture is about 43 percent visible, 49 percent infrared, and 7 percent ultraviolet. But after the sunlight interacts with our atmosphere, which reflects some and absorbs some, what reaches the surface has a larger percentage of visible light. The amount of infrared stays roughly the same, while the amount of ultraviolet light decreases slightly."
Which planet in our solar system is hottest?,Venus,Mercury,Earth,Mars,Venus,"Although Venus lies 90 percent farther from the Sun than Mercury, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. The reason is the thick layer of carbon dioxide clouds, which create a planetwide greenhouse effect. Venus’ surface temperature is an astounding 867 degrees Fahrenheit (464 degrees Celsius) — hot enough to melt both tin and lead."

Jupiter doesn’t have a solid surface, but at its cloud tops, your weight would read 354 pounds (160.6 kg). (Note that your mass in kilograms would never actually change, but your scale is calibrated for Earth and would change its readout.)"
What is the Oort Cloud?,"A vast, distant shell of icy objects surrounding the Solar System","A vast, dense ring of rocky and metallic objects orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter","A massive, spherical cloud of dust and gas that surrounds the entire Milky Way galaxy","A distant collection of icy comets located beyond Neptune’s orbit, also known as the Kuiper Belt.","A vast, distant shell of icy objects surrounding the Solar System","It’s a sphere of perhaps trillions of planetesimals (small rocky or icy bodies) that surround the solar system. Dutch astronomer Jan Oort proposed the idea in 1950. The closest Oort Cloud bodies lie roughly 2,000 astronomical units (AU; 1 astronomical unit is equal to the average Earth-Sun distance of 93 million miles [150 million kilometers]) away.

However, the surface of our satellite contains only 9,137 craters that are officially recognized and named by the IAU."
Which is the reddest naked-eye star?,Antares,V Hydrae,Aldebaran,Betelgeuse,V Hydrae,"That would be carbon star V Hydrae, a variable star in the constellation Hydra. It normally hovers at 6th magnitude, but can drop to 12th magnitude at the faint end of a 17.5 year cycle. If you look at it through a telescope, defocus the image slightly to make the color more apparent."
Which constellation is largest?,Hydra,Ursa Major,Orion,Virgo,Hydra,"Hydra the Water Snake is the largest constellation. It covers 1,302.84 square degrees, or 3.158 percent, of the sky. The next two largest star patterns are Virgo (1,294.43 square degrees/3.138 percent) and Ursa Major (1,279.66 square degrees/3.102 percent). This trio can be seen in the Northern Hemisphere’s spring sky."

What is a black hole?,A  massive star that has exploded but still shines brightly with intense radiation and light,"The remnant of a star about to explode in a supernova, still holding its shape but unstable.",The collapsed core of a massive star whose gravity is so strong that nothing can escape,"A huge celestial object like a planet with extremely strong gravity, but still allowing light to escape",The collapsed core of a massive star whose gravity is so strong that nothing can escape,"This amazing object is the end product of the largest supernova explosions. (Note I’m talking here about stellar-mass black holes, different from supermassive black holes; see the next question.) As part of the explosion, the star’s core collapses to a point where gravity overwhelms every other force. Nothing — not even light — can escape from a black hole."
Is the Moon moving away from Earth?,"No, the Moon stays at a constant distance from Earth because gravitational forces keep it locked in a stable orbit without change","Yes, but the Moon is moving closer to Earth each year as Earth's gravity pulls it inward more strongly","No, the Moon’s distance fluctuates daily but doesn’t show a long-term increase or decrease in distance.","Yes, the Moon’s distance from Earth increases gradually each year due to tidal forces","Yes, the Moon’s distance from Earth increases gradually each year due to tidal forces","Yes, it is. The Moon’s distance from us is increasing by 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) per year. Tides on Earth caused by the Moon are slowing our planet’s rotation. As our planet’s spin slows, the Moon’s speed increases and it moves farther away, to keep the whole system balanced. And here’s some trivia: Because of this increase, in approximately 600 million years, the Moon will appear so small that Earth will no longer experience total solar eclipses."
When will Pluto lie farthest from the Sun?,Pluto has already reached it's farthest point.,Pluto will reach its farthest point in February 2114,"Pluto’s orbit keeps it the same distance from the Sun at all times, never reaching a point that’s farther than usual.",Pluto’s aphelion occurs roughly every century but exact dates are unknown due to its irregular orbit and interactions with Neptune,Pluto will reach its farthest point in February 2114,"In February 2114, Pluto will reach aphelion, its farthest distance from the Sun. At that time, it will lie 49.3 AU away, which is 4.58 billion miles (7.38 billion km). Also at that time, Pluto will be traveling at its slowest orbital speed, approximately 8,280 mph (13,325 km/h)."
